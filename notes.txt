rr:  Spoke with Michael.  They were setting up a pair of SSL clients going to one SSL server.  They 
had one set up properly and working.  the second one was giving them trouble.  It was getting an 
Error #988: SSL Handshake Failed message when they tested it from SMP.  Had him look at SYSLOG, 
Audit, and Cconsole.log messages.  Nothing logged.  used:

%SYS>D ^REDEBUG

to set the flags to FFFFFFFF

retested and then set the flags back to FF.

Checked out the cconsole.log file.  There was a message PEM_do_header: Bad Password Read.

Had them reset the password.  Worked.  All set on this issue.

Tokens, urls, etc.

redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&
response_type=code&
client_id=577750054847-q31iijr2ud8pb3agp5oss1u5bnj9gog0.apps.googleusercontent.com

3. From here you'll get the auth code - use in this curl to get access_token:

curl -v https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token -d \
        "client_secret=HJmTlbPIKrtX9l2Rya7pc_Xd&grant_type=authorization_code&code=4/vMBkqc1jCil5laOmCtVircv0bY1o.AhCEs1eO8_0ZaDn_6y0ZQNjCRxHLiAI&client_id=577750054847-q31iijr2ud8pb3agp5oss1u5bnj9gog0.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"
